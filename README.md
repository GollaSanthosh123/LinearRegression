# 📈 Student Score Prediction App  

This is a simple **Streamlit web application** that predicts a student’s **exam score** based on the number of hours they studied.  
The model uses **Polynomial Regression** (degree 4) trained on a dataset of student study hours vs. scores.

## 🚀 Features  
- Interactive **Streamlit interface**  
- Enter **hours of study** to predict the expected score  
- Displays **R² score** and **Mean Squared Error** for model performance  
- Shows a comparison of **actual vs. predicted scores** on sample test data  

## 📝 Dataset  
The app uses a CSV file named `student_scores.csv` containing two columns:  
- `hours` – number of study hours  
- `scores` – corresponding student scores
